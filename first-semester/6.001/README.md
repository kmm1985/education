### [6.001: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][1]

#### Course Format
I will generally follow the [Syllabus][2] on the [course site][1].  I plan to
use the following schedule for the course:
    *  Lectures on Monday and Wednesday
    *  Recitations on Tuesday and Thursday
On lecture days I will read the [lecture notes][3] and on recitation days I will
do the [readings][4].  Since the [course site][1] does not include weekly assignments
I will do the exercises in the [book][5].  My "weekly assignments" will be due on
Fridays.

The [course site][1] does not include problem sets and as such I will not complete
them.  The [site][1] is also lacking a final exam which I will also not be able to
complete, however I do plan to complete Chapter 5 of the [book][5](a complete Scheme
implementation) as one of my non-trivial software projects for this [project][6].
Since my goal for this [project][6] is just learning, I will not be attempting to
grade myself.  Anyone is free to look at my work and make their own value judgements
about my efforts.

#### Class Schedule.
I am planning to more or less follow the [calendar][7] and if all goes according
to the plan, I should be finished with this course in 13 weeks.  I will track my
progress in an aptly named file in this folder.
