### [18.014: Calculus With Theory][1]

#### Course Format
Since there are no lecture notes or video lectures on the [site][1], I will
simply be doing the [readings][2] and completing the exercises from the book
three days per week(Monday, Wednesday, and Friday).  For all other things I
will follow the calendar on the course [syllabus][3] page.
