### [8.012: Physics I: Classical Mechanics][1]

#### Course Format
This is another simple course, lacking lecture notes or video lectures, so I will
do the [readings][2] twice weekly(Tuesdays and Thursdays) and will follow the
[calendar][3] for all other matters.  Scheduled exams will be on Fridays.
