### [20L.000: Writing about Literature][1]

#### Course Format
This will most likely be the single most challenging course for me in this [project][2].
As I'm sure anyone reading this(and my other README files) can tell, I am a terrible
writer.  Anyhow, for this class I will simply read the books and write the [essays][3]
as the calendar on the [syllabus][4].  Since I am doing this [project][2] alone, I will
not be able to take part in any discussions, so the reading and writing will have to do.
I am certain that the work I submit would not pass in an actual university setting, but
I will take this as seriously as I can.
