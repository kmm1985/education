# Education
## My simulated undergraduate degree using [MIT Open Courseware][1]

### Objective
This project is an attempt to simulate an undergraduate education.  I will
be using [MIT's Open Courseware][1] and following an actual curriculum to ensure
that I cover a complete education that someone would receive from a university.
I am planning to complete MIT's [Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and
Engineering][2] plan, with one deviation: I will be studying the "old curriculum":
[6.001][3], [6.002][4], and [6.003][5], instead of [6.01][6] and [6.02][7], as
that is what I would have studied if I hadn't been a moron as a youngster, _and_
I really want to complete [_Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_][8].

### Format
As stated above, I will be following an actual curriculum.  I will be studying in
eight "semesters", which may not be normalized in time since I am an adult with
some real life responsibilities(although fewer and less serious than someone my
age ought to have).  I will complete all of the requirements of my chosen major,
including the [MIT HASS][9] requirement.

I will not be taking any physical education classes, but I am fully capable of
swimming(and willing to prove such to any doubters), and I am currently engaged
in a rigorous physical fitness program(I've lost about 115 pounds in the last
year or so as well as increasing my overall strength and endurance) which I have
no plan to quit, and I occasionally play golf.  I believe I am at least as
physically fit(and likely much more so) as the average MIT student/graduate
and will count that as passing the [physical education requirement][10].

Any other modifications to the actual [MIT Computer Science and Engineering][2]
curriculum not mentioned above will be listed below in the curriculum plan.  Also,
each "semeseter" and each class will have its own course format document in its
directory which will outline any modifications to the actual curriculum.

### Curriculum
I plan to take the following classes to fulfill my education requirements:

* [General Institute Requirements][11]
  * [Science Requirement][12]
    * [8.012: Physics I: Classical Mechanics][13]
    * [8.022: Physics II: Electricity and Magnetism][14]
    * [5.111: Principles of Chemical Science][15]
    * [18.014: Calculus with Theory][16]
    * [18.024: Multivariable Calculus with Theory][17]
    * [7.012: Introduction to Biology][18]
  * [HASS Requirement][9]
    * [14.01: Principles of Microeconomics][19](Economics Concentration)
    * [14.02: Principles of Macroeconomics][20](Economics Concentration)
    * [14.12: Economic Applications of Game Theory][21](Economics Concentration)
    * [6.073: Creating Video Games][22](HASS A)
    * [6.207: Networks][23](HASS S)
    * [21L.000: Writing About Literature][24](Hass H)(CI-HW)
    * [6.805: Ethics and Laws on the Electronic Frontier][25](HASS S)
    * [24.00: Problems in Philosophy][26](HASS H)(CI-H)
  * [REST Requirement][27]
    * Satisfied by Major requirements.
  * [Laboratory Requirement][28]
    * Satisfied by Major requirements.
  * [Communication Requirement][29]
    * Satisfied by HASS(CI-HW and CI-H) and Major(Two CI-M) requirements.
  * [Physical Education Requirement][10]
    * See above under the "Format" section for my completion of this requirement.
  * Major Requirements
    * Required Subjects
    * [6.001: Structure and Interpretatio of Computer Programs][3]
    * [6.002: Circuits and Electronics][4]
    * [6.003: Signals and Systems][5]
    * [6.UAT and 6.UAP][30](This course is not offered on [Open Courseware][1].
        I will instead create and document two non-trivial software projects to
        satisfy this requirement.  I do not have an advisor...if someone who has
        taken these classes(or an educator at a major university) would like to
        offer free advice should they stumble upon my project, I would appreciate
        that... otherwise I will hope that the projects that I choose to make will
        be appropriate for the level of education that I am trying to simulate.
