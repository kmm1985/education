# Education
## My simulated undergraduate degree using [MIT Open Courseware][OCW]

### Objective
This project is an attempt to simulate an undergraduate education.  I will
be using [MIT's Open Courseware][OCW] and following an actual curriculum to ensure
that I cover a complete education that someone would receive from a university.
I am planning to complete MIT's [Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and
Engineering][CS Degree] plan, with one deviation: I will be studying the "old
curriculum", [6.001][SICP], [6.002][Circuits and Electronics], and [6.003][Signals and Systems]
instead of 6.01 and 6.02, as that is what I would have studied if I hadn't been a
moron as a youngster _and_ I really want to complete [_Structure and Interpretation
of Computer Programs_][SICP Book].

### Format
As stated above, I will be following an actual curriculum.  I will be studying in
eight "semesters", which may not be normalized in time since I am an adult with
some real life responsibilities(although fewer and less serious than someone my
age ought to have).  I will complete all of the requirements of my chosen major,
including the [MIT HASS][HASS Requirement] requirement.

I will not be taking any physical education classes, but I am fully capable of
swimming(and willing to prove such to any doubters), and I am currently engaged
in a rigorous physical fitness program(I've lost about 115 pounds in the last
year or so as well as increasing my overall strength and endurance) which I have
no plan to quit, and I occasionally play golf.  I believe I am at least as
physically fit(and likely much more so) as the average MIT student/graduate
and will count that as passing the [physical education requirement][PE Requirement].

Any other modifications to the actual [MIT Computer Science and Engineering][CS Degree]
curriculum not mentioned above will be listed below in the curriculum plan.  Also,
each "semeseter" and each class will have its own course format document in its
directory.

### Curriculum
I plan to take the following classes to fulfill my education requirements:

* [General Institute Requirements][GIR]

   * Satisfied by Major requirements.

   * See above under the "Format" section for my completion of this requirement.
* Major Requirements
 * Required Subjects
   * [6.001][SICP]
   * [6.002][Circuits and Electronics]
   * [6.003][Signals and Systems]
   * [6.UAT and 6.UAP][Undergraduate Advanced Project](This course is not offered
     on [Open Courseware][OCW].  I will instead create and document two non-trivial
     software projects to satisfy this requirement.  I do not have an advisor...if
     someone who has taken these classes(or an educator at a major university) would
     like to offer free advice should they stumble upon my project, I would appreciate
     that... otherwise I will hope that the projects that I choose to make will be
     appropriate for the level of education that I am trying to simulate.
